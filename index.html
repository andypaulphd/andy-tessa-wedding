<p>
  Asheville has its own regional airport, but often it makes more sense to fly into Charlotte <b>(CLT)</b>, which is a two hour drive away. Even though you'll be renting a car for a couple of days, you'll likely save some money with cheaper airfare. And you 'll probably save time too, since flying into Asheville means you'll need to make a connection in somewhere like Atlanta or Charlotte anyways.

  There are countless hotels in Asheville to choose from, but there are two that are both downtown and in walking distance of the wedding venue.

<h2><a name="What to Do in Asheville">What to Do in Asheville</a>
</h2>
<p>
  Here's a short list of things to do while you're in town, starting with quick diversions and ending with longer excursions.
</p>
<h3>The Grove Arcade</h3>
<h4>1 Page Ave, Asheville, NC 28801</h4>
<p>Downtown Asheville is small and easily walkable, so you should feel free to explore if you have an hour or two. But this is a good place to start and it's Gerry's favorite. It's a historic building that was renovated with shops, restaurants, and our favorite wine bar, Santé. (Also check out the nearby bookstore Malaprop's at 55 Haywood St., one of the biggest indie bookstores in the Southeast.)</p>
<h3>Botanical Gardens</h3>
<h4>151 W T. Weaver Boulevard, Asheville, NC 28804 | <a target="_blank" href="https://ashevillebotanicalgardens.org/">website</a></h4>
<p>The Botanical Gardens are right next to the University of North Carolina Asheville, which are both just a mile from downtown—a short car ride and free parking and admission.</p>
<h3>Asheville Brewery District ("The South Slope")</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/TJLMaqiJSoiMfgXw7">Google Maps link</a></h4>
<p>Asheville has more beer breweries per capita than anywhere else, at least last time we checked. You can walk to the South Slope from anywhere downtown, and visit a good number of them. (Check out Bhramari Brewing Company or Catawba Brewing Company for starters.)</p>
<h3>Biltmore Estate</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biltmore.com/">Link to the Biltmore Website</a></h4>
<p>This is the place to go if you have a full day in Asheville. It's a really big house. They have tours of the house and grounds, and they also have their own winery where you can go for tastings.</p>

<p>
  We don't like gewgaws and tchotchkes—plastic things that will end up collecting dust.
</p>
<p>
  So we've set up a "cash registry" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theknot.com/us/tessa-branson-and-andy-paul-jun-2021/registry">at this website</a>. We'd love it if you helped us in raising money for our honeymoon.
</p>
<p>
  If the above linked website is too garish for you—or if you want to forego the service fee—you can send cash directly to our venmo account: <a target="_blank" href="https://venmo.com/Tessa-and-Andy-Paul">@Tessa-and-Andy-Paul</a>
